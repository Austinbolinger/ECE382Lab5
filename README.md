Documentation: Dr. Coulston explained to me why only taking from timer 0 was bad. Now I understand why the data from timer 1 was most important for determining what the count times were.

Description: Lab 5 is IR signals. Taking lab 3's pong game and making it react to the buttons pressed on a remote control.

**Setup**
This is what the set up looks like in picture form.
![set up]( https://github.com/Austinbolinger/ECE382Lab8/blob/master/setUp.JPG?raw=true "Set Up" )

O is for Output pin. G is for Ground pin. Vcc is for the power pin. And, the Output pin was actually attached to the Xin pin on the MSP430 not the port 1.3.

**Firmware**

Project built around [test5.c](http://ecse.bd.psu.edu/cmpen352/lab/lab5/test5.c)

1. How long will it take the timer to roll over?
  65535/8000000= 8.192ms
2. How long does each timer count last?
  It counts up to 0xFFFF
3. The while(1) loop in main reads in the ir pules in the for loop. Annotate the picture below to describe the which lines of the for loop the program is executed at which part of the pulse. You should show a total of 6 lines of code (lines 32-34 and lines 36-38).
  Lines 32-34, write to timer 0 which is the count for the bottom line of the IR wave. Lines 36-38, write to timer 1 which is the count length for the top line, high signal, for the IR wave.

**IR data packets**

This is the print outs from the Logic Anlyizer. They helped me realize the value of the time 0 and time 1 variables. After analyzing the time 0 and time 1, I soon realized that I only needed to look at time 1 for the 1 counts. I made an Excel sheet to easily record the data for each button press and do my math calculations quickly.

If you look at the picture below, you can see that I mapped out the time0 before realizing how unimportant it was to me. However, it did help me to realize how time 1 could help me.

1. List the lengths of the pulses generated by the remote control in absolute time using the O'scope (3 significant figures) and in timer A counts.

| Pulse | Duration (ms) | timer A counts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start logic 0 half-pulse | 1.11 |  89450 |
| Start logic 1 half-pulse | 0.553  | 4420 |
| Data 1 logic 0 half-pulse | 0.0770 | 616  |
| Data 1 logic 1 half-pulse | 0.206 | 1650  |
| Data 0 logic 0 half-pulse | 0.0770 | 616 |
| Data 0 logic 1 half-pulse | 0.0678 | 542 |
| Stop logic 0 half-pulse | 0.0771 | 620 |
| Stop logic 1 half-pulse | 5.369 | 42952 |

2. Collect 8 samples of timer A counts for each of the following pulse types. Compute the average and standard deviation of each pulse type. I would suggest just grabbing it from the CCS variables tab.

| Data | Logic half-pulse | Average Count | Avg. Time(ms) | St. Dev. Count | St. Dev. Time(ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 507.6 | 0.00635 | 25.3 | 0.00316 |
| 1 | 1 | 1621.9 | 0.203 | 28.99 | 0.00362 |
| 0 | 0 | 617 | 0.0771 | 3.13 | 0.000392 |
| 0 | 1 | 617 | 0.0771 | 3.13 | 0.000392 |

3.Tabulate this information in Excel, label the rows and columns of your table so that I will know what the information in each cell means.
